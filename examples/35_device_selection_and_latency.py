"""Example 35 -- device selection, fp32 off CUDA, and device latency.

Laya picks CUDA, then MPS, then CPU when `device=None`. This example times the multilingual
checkpoint on CPU and on MPS (if present), prints median ms and ms/question, and checks that the
two devices return the same answers.

    Device resolution in `Agent.__init__`: an explicit `device=` wins (with a warning and a
    fallback to CPU if it is unavailable), otherwise CUDA, then MPS, then CPU. Precision follows
    the device -- mixed precision (bf16/fp16) is a CUDA win, while CPU and MPS run **fp32**;
    `torch.autocast` has no MPS backend here, so Laya only wraps the forward pass on CUDA.

    For explicit control pass `device="cpu"`, `"mps"` or `"cuda"`. Laya does not read an env var
    itself, but a common application pattern is to read one (`LAYA_DEVICE`) and pass it through.

    `timed(fn, repeat=3)` discards one warm-up call, so the first MPS call's ~13 s of Metal
    kernel compilation does not pollute the median. Both legs answer the same question set.
