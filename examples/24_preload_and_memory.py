    A cold checkpoint build costs seconds; language detection costs microseconds. At the
    default `max_loaded=1`, traffic that alternates languages rebuilds a model on every
    switch. `router.loaded` is the residency view, least-recently-used first, so you can
    watch models enter and leave as traffic moves between languages.

    A server preloads instead. Here we also show `attach()`, which registers an Agent the
    process already built rather than paying for -- and holding -- a duplicate copy.
